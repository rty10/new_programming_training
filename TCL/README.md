# TCL training

Contents of this directory are from personal training with .tcl scripting for molecular dynamics data processing and automation of VMD-specific tasks.
Scripts 1-4 are commented .tcl basics that use data found in the `data` directory and are designed to be execute with VMD from command line (Ubunutu 22.04 terminal through Windows Subsystem) as follows:
`$ vmd -e <script_name>.tcl`
or 
`$ vmd -dispdev none -e <script_name>.tcl`
